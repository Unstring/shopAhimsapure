This isn\'t just a label for us; it\'s a commitment that permeates every aspect of our work, from the tiniest microbe in the soil to the families we serve.\\n\\n### Beyond the \'Organic\' Label\\n\\nWhile all our products are produced using organic principles, our philosophy goes much deeper. For us, Ahimsa in dairy means:\\n\\n*   **Non-violence to the Earth:** We practice regenerative agriculture, which focuses on building and improving soil health. Instead of depleting the land, we aim to leave it healthier and more fertile for future generations. Our cows graze on pastures free from synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers.\\n*   **Non-violence to Animals:** Our dairy products come from cows that are treated with love and respect. They graze freely on open pastures, are not given hormones or unnecessary antibiotics, and are cared for as part of our extended family. Calves get their rightful share of milk first.\\n*   **Non-violence to our Farmers:** We believe in fair trade. Our partner farmers are the backbone of AhimsaPure. We ensure they receive fair prices for their produce, providing them with a sustainable livelihood and empowering their communities.\\n*   **Non-violence to You:** Ultimately, our promise extends to you, our customer. By providing pure, unadulterated, and nutrient-dense A2 dairy products, we are helping you nourish your body in the most natural way possible. We believe that what you eat should be a source of health and vitality, not a cause for concern.\\n\\n### A Full Circle of Care\\n\\nThis holistic approach creates a virtuous cycle. Healthy soil grows healthy fodder, which nourishes our healthy cows, who in turn provide wholesome milk for you. By supporting AhimsaPure, you\'re not just buying dairy; you\'re becoming part of a movement that values sustainability, ethical practices, and the well-being of all.

However, not all ghee is created equal. The distinction of A2 Ghee, particularly when made using the traditional Bilona method, places it in a class of its own.\\n\\n### What is A2 Ghee?\\n\\nA2 Ghee is made from the milk of indigenous Indian cow breeds like Gir and Sahiwal. These cows produce milk that contains the A2 beta-casein protein, which is molecularly different from the A1 protein found in most commercial, hybrid cow milk. Many people find A2 protein easier to digest, making it a suitable choice even for those with sensitivities.\\n\\n### The Bilona Method: A Labor of Love\\n\\nAt AhimsaPure, we follow the ancient Bilona process:\\n1.  **Milking:** Pure A2 milk is collected from our free-grazing cows.\\n2.  **Curdling:** The whole milk is boiled, cooled, and then inoculated with a starter culture to make curd.\\n3.  **Churning:** The curd is churned in two directions using a wooden churner (a \'bilona\') to separate the white butter (makkhan).\\n4.  **Heating:** The collected butter is slowly heated on a low flame to clarify it, leaving behind the pure, golden ghee.\\n\\nThis slow, deliberate process ensures that the ghee retains its full nutrient profile, including essential fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants.\\n\\n### Benefits of A2 Ghee\\n\\n*   **Improves Digestion:** It stimulates the secretion of stomach acids, aiding in proper digestion.\\n*   **Boosts Immunity:** Rich in fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K, which are crucial for a strong immune system.\\n*   **High Smoke Point:** It\'s an excellent cooking medium as it doesn\'t break down into harmful free radicals at high temperatures.\\n*   **Nourishes the Body:** In Ayurveda, it\'s considered a \'rasayana\' - a rejuvenating food that promotes longevity and vitality.\\n\\nBy choosing AhimsaPure\'s A2 Bilona Ghee, you are not just adding flavor to your food; you are embracing an ancient tradition of wellness."}]')},44838:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{SQ:()=>m,_2:()=>u,lp:()=>f,mB:()=>p,rI:()=>c,ty:()=>h});var o=a(95155),i=a(12115),r=a(76215),s=a(73158),n=a(10518),d=a(70154),l=a(59434);let c=r.bL,h=r.l9;r.YJ,r.ZL,r.Pb,r.z6,i.forwardRef((e,t)=>{let{className:a,inset:i,children:n,...d}=e;return(0,o.jsxs)(r.ZP,{ref:t,className:(0,l.cn)("flex cursor-default gap-2 select-none items-center rounded-sm px-2 py-1.5 text-sm outline-none focus:bg-accent data-[state=open]:bg-accent [&_svg]:pointer-events-none [&_svg]:size-4 [&_svg]:shrink-0",i&&"pl-8",a),...d,children:[n,(0,o.jsx)(s.A,{className:"ml-auto"})]})}).displayName=r.ZP.displayName,i.forwardRef((e,t)=>{let{className:a,...i}=e;return(0,o.jsx)(r.G5,{ref:t,className:(0,l.cn)("z-50 min-w-[8rem] overflow-hidden rounded-md border bg-popover p-1 text-popover-foreground shadow-lg data-[state=open]:animate-in data-[state=closed]:animate-out data-[state=closed]:fade-out-0 data-[state=open]:fade-in-0 data-[state=closed]:zoom-out-95 data-[state=open]:zoom-in-95 data-[side=bottom]:slide-in-from-top-2 data-[side=left]:slide-in-from-right-2 data-[side=right]:slide-in-from-left-2 data-[side=top]:slide-in-from-bottom-2",a),...i})}).displayName=r.G5.displayName;let m=i.forwardRef((e,t)=>{let{className:a,sideOffset:i=4,...s}=e;return(0,o.jsx)(r.ZL,{children:(0,o.jsx)(r.UC,{ref:t,sideOffset:i,className:(0,l.cn)("z-50 min-w-[8rem] overflow-hidden rounded-md border bg-popover p-1 text-popover-foreground shadow-md data-[state=open]:animate-in data-[state=closed]:animate-out data-[state=closed]:fade-out-0 data-[state=open]:fade-in-0 data-[state=closed]:zoom-out-95 data-[state=open]:zoom-in-95 data-[side=bottom]:slide-in-from-top-2 data-[side=left]:slide-in-from-right-2 data-[side=right]:slide-in-from-left-2 data-[side=top]:slide-in-from-bottom-2",a),...s})})});m.displayName=r.UC.displayName;let u=i.forwardRef((e,t)=>{let{className:a,inset:i,...s}=e;return(0,o.jsx)(r.q7,{ref:t,className:(0,l.cn)("relative flex cursor-default select-none items-center gap-2 rounded-sm px-2 py-1.5 text-sm outline-none transition-colors focus:bg-accent focus:text-accent-foreground data-[disabled]:pointer-events-none data-[disabled]:opacity-50 [&_svg]:pointer-events-none [&_svg]:size-4 [&_svg]:shrink-0",i&&"pl-8",a),...s})});u.displayName=r.q7.displayName,i.forwardRef((e,t)=>{let{className:a,children:i,checked:s,...d}=e;return(0,o.jsxs)(r.H_,{ref:t,className:(0,l.cn)("relative flex cursor-default select-none items-center rounded-sm py-1.5 pl-8 pr-2 text-sm outline-none transition-colors focus:bg-accent focus:text-accent-foreground data-[disabled]:pointer-events-none data-[disabled]:opacity-50",a),checked:s,...d,children:[(0,o.jsx)("span",{className:"absolute left-2 flex h-3.5 w-3.5 items-center justify-center",children:(0,o.jsx)(r.VF,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.A,{className:"h-4 w-4"})})}),i]})}).displayName=r.H_.displayName,i.forwardRef((e,t)=>{let{className:a,children:i,...s}=e;return(0,o.jsxs)(r.hN,{ref:t,className:(0,l.cn)("relative flex cursor-default select-none items-center rounded-sm py-1.5 pl-8 pr-2 text-sm outline-none transition-colors focus:bg-accent focus:text-accent-foreground data-[disabled]:pointer-events-none data-[disabled]:opacity-50",a),...s,children:[(0,o.jsx)("span",{className:"absolute left-2 flex h-3.5 w-3.5 items-center justify-center",children:(0,o.jsx)(r.VF,{children:(0,o.jsx)(d.A,{className:"h-2 w-2 fill-current"})})}),i]})}).displayName=r.hN.displayName;let f=i.forwardRef((e,t)=>{let{className:a,inset:i,...s}=e;return(0,o.jsx)(r.JU,{ref:t,className:(0,l.cn)("px-2 py-1.5 text-sm font-semibold",i&&"pl-8",a),...s})});f.displayName=r.JU.displayName;let p=i.forwardRef((e,t)=>{let{className:a,...i}=e;return(0,o.jsx)(r.wv,{ref:t,className:(0,l.cn)("-mx-1 my-1 h-px bg-muted",a),...i})});p.displayName=r.wv.displayName},56767:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>o});let o=JSON.parse('[{"id":"prod_1","name":"Organic A2 Ghee","description":"Our pure, hand-churned A2 Desi Cow Ghee is a testament to tradition and purity.
