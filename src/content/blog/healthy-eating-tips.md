In ancient Indian traditions, Ghee is revered not just as a cooking fat but as a sacred ingredient with immense healing properties. However, not all ghee is created equal. The distinction of A2 Ghee, particularly when made using the traditional Bilona method, places it in a class of its own.

### What is A2 Ghee?

A2 Ghee is made from the milk of indigenous Indian cow breeds like Gir and Sahiwal. These cows produce milk that contains the A2 beta-casein protein, which is molecularly different from the A1 protein found in most commercial, hybrid cow milk. Many people find A2 protein easier to digest, making it a suitable choice even for those with sensitivities.

### The Bilona Method: A Labor of Love

At AhimsaPure, we follow the ancient Bilona process:
1.  **Milking:** Pure A2 milk is collected from our free-grazing cows.
2.  **Curdling:** The whole milk is boiled, cooled, and then inoculated with a starter culture to make curd.
3.  **Churning:** The curd is churned in two directions using a wooden churner (a 'bilona') to separate the white butter (makkhan).
4.  **Heating:** The collected butter is slowly heated on a low flame to clarify it, leaving behind the pure, golden ghee.

This slow, deliberate process ensures that the ghee retains its full nutrient profile, including essential fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants.

### Benefits of A2 Ghee

*   **Improves Digestion:** It stimulates the secretion of stomach acids, aiding in proper digestion.
*   **Boosts Immunity:** Rich in fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K, which are crucial for a strong immune system.
*   **High Smoke Point:** It's an excellent cooking medium as it doesn't break down into harmful free radicals at high temperatures.
*   **Nourishes the Body:** In Ayurveda, it's considered a 'rasayana' - a rejuvenating food that promotes longevity and vitality.

By choosing AhimsaPure's A2 Bilona Ghee, you are not just adding flavor to your food; you are embracing an ancient tradition of wellness.
